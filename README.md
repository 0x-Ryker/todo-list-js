# todo-list-js

This is a simple to-do list website built using JavaScript. The website allows users to create, manage, and keep track of their tasks in an organized manner.

Features

Add Tasks: Users can easily add new tasks to the to-do list by entering the task description and clicking the "Add" button.

Mark as Complete: Once a task is completed, users can mark it as complete, which visually distinguishes it from the remaining tasks.

Delete Tasks: Users can delete individual tasks from the list if they no longer need them.

Persistence: The to-do list supports persistence, meaning that tasks will be saved even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser. The tasks will be restored when the user returns to the website.

Usage:
Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

You will see the simple interface of the to-do list website.

To add a task, type the task description in the input field provided and click the "Add" button.

To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.

The tasks will be automatically saved and restored when you revisit the website.
